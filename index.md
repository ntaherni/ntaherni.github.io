In the words of Thomas Powell:
> Everyone writes bad code.

- I hope to be able to improve my own codewriting skills this quarter.
- I also hope to learn more about the different JavaScript frameworks and the extent of what I can do with different `<var>` types. I've done a bit in the past but not really anything in depth.
